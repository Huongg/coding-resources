It offers a mix of fun lessons, practical exercises, and rewards for your progress. </br></br>The only problem I had is that I can get the solution very easily when stuck. I found that I lost a bit of motivation to fully understand the solution. It is kind of a passive learning for me</p>",

The course runs once a week in the evening.</br> I was struggling for the first 2 weeks as there was so much new knowledge I needed to understand (github, git, commandline, how the internet works). </br></br> Having said that, it is not impossible to learn. It will be always hard when you learn something completely new. Just keep learning is the key and it will be rewarding at the end!",
